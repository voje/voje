👋 Hi, I'm @voje

💫 I like to keep in touch with various tech stacks from down-below Linux networking and systems programming to high-above web frontend programming.   

📑 At my current occupation, I'm working on 5g core software. It's REST API microservices that need some tweaking on the Linux and networking side to work properly.   

😏 Enthusiastic about cybersecurity, I like to follow the latest threat reports from SANS and a few experts on Twitter. It's always fun to think about how someone is going to break the app you're writing.   

📚 Currently learning:
* 📖 Rust -- my daily driver Golang is too plain and C++ is too boilerplate-y for personal projects. Rust seems like a great candidate for a general-purpose programming language that also keeps you on the toes and forces you to write good quality code.   
* 📘 React -- React Hooks came out recently so I'm refreshing my webdev skills going through an Udemy course. It's good to be able to slap a pretty frontend on whatever you're building, else nodody will ever use your cli application.
