👋 Hi, I'm @voje
💫 I like to keep in touch with various tech stacks from down-below Linux networking and systems programming to high-above web frontend programming.   
📑 At my current occupation, I'm working on 5g core software. It's REST API microservices that need some tweaking on the Linux and networking side to work properly.   
😏 Enthusiastic about cybersecurity, I like to follow the latest threat reports from SANS and a few experts on Twitter. It's always fun to think about how someone is going to break the app you're writing.   

Currently learning:
* 📖Rust -- my daily driver Golang is a bit too plain and C++ is a bit too boilerplate-y for personal projects. Rust seems a great candidate for a general purpose programming language.   
* 📘React -- React Hooks came out recently so I'm refreshing my webdev skills on that one. It's good to be able to slap a pretty frontend on whatever you're building, else nodody will ever use your cli application.
