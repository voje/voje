ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name's Kristjan.

ðŸ’« Professionally, I'm a DevOps Engineer at a telco company where I focus on Kubernetes and end-to-end deployment automation (deployment of whole platforms in air-gapped environments).   

Here's a high level overview of tools, languages, frameworks and platforms I'm comfortable with.   

Operating Systems and daily drivers:
* Ubuntu cloud -- most comfortable one
* Fedora, RHEL, RHCOS -- when working with Openshift
* Alpine -- base container image
* Arch -- old personal laptop, efficient use of hardware
* Windows + WSL2 -- current daily driver; good for programming (Linux shell) without losing Windows features (company compliance...)

Cloud platforms:
* OpenStack -- tenant admin (networks, storage, routers, ...)
* vSphere -- deploying VMs
* AWS -- deploying VMs
* OCI -- deploying VMs, some networking

Container platforms:
* Kubernetes -- deployment from scratch; favorite distro is k3s, using Kubeadm and Rancher for work projects
* OpenShift 4 -- deployment from scratch (UPI), had to leran it for a work project, prefer vanilla Kubernetes

Tools:
* Helm -- go-to tool for deploying apps on k8s
* Terraform -- go-to tool for interacting with any cloud
* Ansible -- go-to tool for provisioning (Linux) servers

Programming languages (profficient - daily usage):
* Golang -- backend services, REST APIs, cli tools
* bash -- automation, scripting
* Python -- automation when bash gets too verbose; string manipulation with Jinja2; data manipulation with Pandas; general purpose get-stuff-done-quickly language

Other programming languages (pp - personal projects, uni - university, pro - professional development):
* Rust -- pp, staying in programming shape
* Kotlin -- pp, Android Studio app
* Elixir -- pp, web scraping
* Haskell -- pp. Advent of Code
* C++ -- uni, pp, OpenCV, QT
* Java -- uni
* C -- pro, fixing bugs on old telco apps
* JavaScript -- I like to use TypeScript wherever possible
  * Vue framework -- pro, internal dashboards
  * React framework -- pp
  * Electron -- pp
