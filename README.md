ðŸ‘‹ Hi,

ðŸ’« DevOps and some Backend engineering by trade. 

ðŸ“‘ At my current occupation, I'm working on 5g core software. It's REST API microservices that need some tweaking on the Linux and networking side to work properly.   

ðŸ“š Current interests:
* ðŸ“– Rust -- my daily driver Golang is too plain and C++ is too boilerplate-y for personal projects. Rust seems like a great candidate for a general-purpose programming language that also keeps you on the toes and forces you to write good quality code.   
* ðŸ“˜ React -- React Hooks came out recently. Not super focused on webdev but I think it's useful to write up a quick dashboard now and then.   
* ðŸ”§ Ansible -- Automation is cool.   
* âš“ K8S -- I find a lot of my coworkers are afraid of K8S... I don't really blame them.
